<introduction>
<p>We saw in <acroref type="theorem" acro="CINM" /> that if a square matrix $A$ is nonsingular, then there is a matrix $B$ so that $AB=I_n$.  In other words, $B$ is halfway to being an inverse of $A$.  We will see in this section that $B$ automatically fulfills the second condition ($BA=I_n$).  <acroref type="example" acro="MWIAA" /> showed us that the coefficient matrix from <acroref type="archetype" acro="A" /> had no inverse.  Not coincidentally, this coefficient matrix is singular.  We will make all these connections precise now.  Not many examples or definitions in this section, just theorems.</p>

</introduction>

<subsection acro="NMI">
<title>Nonsingular Matrices are Invertible</title>

<p>We need a couple of technical results for starters.  Some books would call these minor, but essential, results <q>lemmas.</q>  We'll just call 'em theorems.  See <acroref type="technique" acro="LC" /> for more on the distinction.</p>

<p>The first of these technical results is interesting in that the hypothesis says something about a product of two square matrices and the conclusion then says the same thing about each individual matrix in the product.  This result has an analogy in the algebra of complex numbers: suppose $\alpha,\,\beta\in\complexes$, then $\alpha\beta\neq 0$ if and only if $\alpha\neq 0$ and $\beta\neq 0$.  We can view this result as suggesting that the term <q>nonsingular</q> for matrices is like the term <q>nonzero</q> for scalars.  Consider too that we know singular matrices, as coefficient matrices for systems of equations, will sometimes lead to systems with no solutions, or systems with infinitely many solutions (<acroref type="theorem" acro="NMUS" />).  What do linear equations with zero look like?  Consider $0x=5$, which has no solution, and $0x=0$, which has infinitely many solutions.  In the algebra of scalars, zero is exceptional (meaning different, not better), and in the algebra of matrices, singular matrices are also the exception.  While there is only one zero scalar, and there are infinitely many singular matrices, we will see that singular matrices are a distinct minority.</p>

<theorem acro="NPNT" index="nonsingular matrix!product of nonsingular matrices">
<title>Nonsingular Product has Nonsingular Terms</title>
<statement>
<p>Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are square matrices of size $n$.  The product $AB$ is nonsingular if and only if $A$ and $B$ are both nonsingular.</p>

</statement>

<proof>
<p><implyforward /> For this portion of the proof we will form the logically-equivalent contrapositive and prove that statement using two cases.  <q>$AB$ is nonsingular implies $A$ and $B$ are both nonsingular</q> becomes <q>$A$ or $B$ is singular implies $AB$ is singular.</q>  (Be sure to undertstand why the <q>and</q> became an <q>or</q>, see <acroref type="technique" acro="CP" />.)</p>

<p>Case 1.  Suppose $B$ is singular.  Then there is a nonzero vector $\vect{z}$ that is a solution to $\homosystem{B}$.  So
<alignmath>
(AB)\vect{z}
<![CDATA[&=A(B\vect{z})&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="MMA" />\\
<![CDATA[&=A\zerovector&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="SLEMM" />\\
<![CDATA[&=\zerovector&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="MMZM" />\\
</alignmath></p>

<p>With <acroref type="theorem" acro="SLEMM" /> we can translate this vector equality to the statement that $\vect{z}$ is a nonzero solution to $\homosystem{AB}$.  Thus $AB$ is singular (<acroref type="definition" acro="NM" />), as desired.</p>

<p>Case 2.  Suppose $A$ is singular, and $B$ is not singular.  In other words, with Case 1 complete, we can be more precise about this remaining case and assume that $B$ is nonsingular.  Because $A$ is singular, there is a nonzero vector $\vect{y}$ that is a solution to $\homosystem{A}$.  Now consider the linear system $\linearsystem{B}{\vect{y}}$.  Since $B$ is nonsingular, the system has a unique solution (<acroref type="theorem" acro="NMUS" />), which we will denote as $\vect{w}$.  We first claim $\vect{w}$ is not the zero vector either.  Assuming the opposite, suppose that $\vect{w}=\zerovector$ (<acroref type="technique" acro="CD" />).  Then
<alignmath>
\vect{y}
<![CDATA[&=B\vect{w}&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="SLEMM" />\\
<![CDATA[&=B\zerovector&&\text{Hypothesis}\\]]>
<![CDATA[&=\zerovector&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="MMZM" />
<intertext>contrary to $\vect{y}$ being nonzero.  So $\vect{w}\neq\zerovector$.  The pieces are in place, so here we go,</intertext>
(AB)\vect{w}
<![CDATA[&=A(B\vect{w})&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="MMA" />\\
<![CDATA[&=A\vect{y}&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="SLEMM" />\\
<![CDATA[&=\zerovector&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="SLEMM" />\\
</alignmath>
</p>

<p>With <acroref type="theorem" acro="SLEMM" /> we can translate this vector equality to the statement that $\vect{w}$ is a nonzero solution to $\homosystem{AB}$.  Thus $AB$ is singular (<acroref type="definition" acro="NM" />), as desired.  And this conclusion holds for both cases.</p>

<p><implyreverse /> Now assume that both $A$ and $B$ are nonsingular.  Suppose that $\vect{x}\in\complex{n}$ is a solution to $\homosystem{AB}$.  Then
<alignmath>
\zerovector
<![CDATA[&=\left(AB\right)\vect{x}&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="SLEMM" />\\
<![CDATA[&=A\left(B\vect{x}\right)&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="MMA" />
</alignmath>
</p>

<p>By <acroref type="theorem" acro="SLEMM" />, $B\vect{x}$ is a solution to $\homosystem{A}$, and by the definition of a nonsingular matrix (<acroref type="definition" acro="NM" />), we conclude that $B\vect{x}=\zerovector$.  Now, by an entirely similar argument, the nonsingularity of $B$ forces us to conclude that $\vect{x}=\zerovector$.  So the only solution to $\homosystem{AB}$ is the zero vector and we conclude that $AB$ is nonsingular by <acroref type="definition" acro="NM" />.</p>

</proof>
</theorem>

<p>This is a powerful result in the <q>forward</q> direction, because it allows us to begin with a hypothesis that something complicated (the matrix product $AB$) has the property of being nonsingular, and we can then conclude that the simpler constituents ($A$ and $B$ individually) then also have the property of being nonsingular.  If we had thought that the matrix product was an artificial construction, results like this would make us begin to think twice.</p>

<p>The contrapositive of this entire result is equally interesting.  It says that $A$ or $B$ (or both) is a singular matrix if and only if the product $AB$ is singular.  (See <acroref type="technique" acro="CP" />.)</p>

<!--   TODO: Insert reference to a technique about negations. -->
<theorem acro="OSIS" index="matrix inverse!one-sided">
<title>One-Sided Inverse is Sufficient</title>
<statement>
<p>Suppose $A$ and $B$ are  square matrices of size $n$ such that $AB=I_n$.  Then $BA=I_n$.</p>

</statement>

<proof>
<p>The matrix $I_n$ is nonsingular (since it row-reduces easily to $I_n$, <acroref type="theorem" acro="NMRRI" />).  So $A$ and $B$ are nonsingular by <acroref type="theorem" acro="NPNT" />, so in particular $B$ is nonsingular.  We can therefore apply <acroref type="theorem" acro="CINM" /> to assert the existence of a matrix $C$ so that $BC=I_n$.  This application of <acroref type="theorem" acro="CINM" /> could be a bit confusing, mostly because of the names of the matrices involved.  $B$ is nonsingular, so there must be a <q>right-inverse</q> for $B$, and we are calling it $C$.</p>

<p>Now
<alignmath>
BA
<![CDATA[&=(BA)I_n&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="MMIM" />\\
<![CDATA[&=(BA)(BC)&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="CINM" />\\
<![CDATA[&=B(AB)C&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="MMA" />\\
<![CDATA[&=BI_nC&&\text{Hypothesis}\\]]>
<![CDATA[&=BC&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="MMIM" />\\
<![CDATA[&=I_n&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="CINM" />
</alignmath>
which is the desired conclusion.</p>

</proof>
</theorem>

<p>So <acroref type="theorem" acro="OSIS" /> tells us that if $A$ is nonsingular, then the matrix $B$ guaranteed by <acroref type="theorem" acro="CINM" /> will be both a <q>right-inverse</q> and a <q>left-inverse</q> for $A$, so $A$ is invertible and $\inverse{A}=B$.</p>

<p>So if you have a nonsingular matrix, $A$, you can use the procedure described in <acroref type="theorem" acro="CINM" /> to find an inverse for $A$.  If $A$ is singular, then the procedure in <acroref type="theorem" acro="CINM" /> will fail as the first $n$ columns of $M$ will not row-reduce to the identity matrix.  However, we can say a bit more.  When $A$ is singular, then $A$ does not have an inverse (which is very different from saying that the procedure in <acroref type="theorem" acro="CINM" /> fails to find an inverse).
This may feel like we are splitting hairs, but it is important that we do not make unfounded assumptions.  These observations motivate the next theorem.</p>

<theorem acro="NI" index="matrix inverse!nonsingular matrix">
<title>Nonsingularity is Invertibility</title>
<statement>
<indexlocation index="nonsingular matrix!matrix inverse" />
<p>Suppose that $A$ is a square matrix.  Then $A$ is nonsingular if and only if $A$ is invertible.</p>

</statement>

<proof>
<p><implyreverse />  Since $A$ is invertible, we can write $I_n=A\inverse{A}$ (<acroref type="definition" acro="MI" />).  Notice that $I_n$ is nonsingular (<acroref type="theorem" acro="NMRRI" />) so <acroref type="theorem" acro="NPNT" /> implies that $A$ (and $\inverse{A}$) is nonsingular.</p>

<p><implyforward />  Suppose now that $A$ is nonsingular.  By <acroref type="theorem" acro="CINM" /> we find $B$ so that $AB=I_n$.  Then <acroref type="theorem" acro="OSIS" /> tells us that $BA=I_n$.  So $B$ is $A$'s inverse, and by construction, $A$ is invertible.</p>

</proof>
</theorem>

<p>So for a square matrix, the properties of having an inverse and of having a trivial null space are one and the same.  Cannot have one without the other.</p>

<theorem acro="NME3" index="nonsingular matrix!equivalences">
<title>Nonsingular Matrix Equivalences, Round 3</title>
<statement>
<p>Suppose that $A$ is a square matrix of size $n$.  The following are equivalent.
<ol><li> $A$ is nonsingular.
</li><li> $A$ row-reduces to the identity matrix.
</li><li> The null space of $A$ contains only the zero vector, $\nsp{A}=\set{\zerovector}$.
</li><li> The linear system $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ has a unique solution for every possible choice of $\vect{b}$.
</li><li> The columns of $A$ are a linearly independent set.
</li><li> $A$ is invertible.
</li></ol>
</p>

</statement>

<proof>
<p>We can update our list of equivalences for nonsingular matrices (<acroref type="theorem" acro="NME2" />) with the equivalent condition from <acroref type="theorem" acro="NI" />.</p>

</proof>
</theorem>

<p>In the case that $A$ is a nonsingular coefficient matrix of a system of equations, the inverse allows us to very quickly compute the unique solution, for any vector of constants.</p>

<theorem acro="SNCM" index="coefficient matrix!nonsingular">
<title>Solution with Nonsingular Coefficient Matrix</title>
<statement>
<p>Suppose that $A$ is nonsingular.  Then the unique solution to $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ is $\inverse{A}\vect{b}$.</p>

</statement>

<proof>
<p>By <acroref type="theorem" acro="NMUS" /> we know already that $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ has a unique solution for every choice of $\vect{b}$.  We need to show that the expression stated is indeed a solution (<em>the</em> solution).  That is easy, just <q>plug it in</q> to the vector equation representation of the system (<acroref type="theorem" acro="SLEMM" />),
<alignmath>
A\left(\inverse{A}\vect{b}\right)
<![CDATA[&=\left(A\inverse{A}\right)\vect{b}&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="MMA" />\\
<![CDATA[&=I_n\vect{b}&&]]><acroref type="definition" acro="MI" />\\
<![CDATA[&=\vect{b}&&]]><acroref type="theorem" acro="MMIM" />
</alignmath>
</p>

<p>Since $A\vect{x}=\vect{b}$ is true when we substitute $\inverse{A}\vect{b}$ for $\vect{x}$, $\inverse{A}\vect{b}$ is a (the!) solution to $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$.</p>

</proof>
</theorem>

<title>Matrix Inverse</title>

<p>Now we know that invertibility is equivalent to nonsingularity, and that the procedure outlined in <acroref type="theorem" acro="CINM" /> will always yield an inverse for a nonsingular matrix.  But rather than using that procedure, Sage implements a <code>.inverse()</code> method.  In the following, we compute the inverse of a $3\times 3$ matrix, and then purposely convert it to a singular matrix by replacing the last column by a linear combination of the first two.</p>

<p>Notice how the failure to invert <code>C</code> is explained by the matrix being singular.</p>

<p>Systems with nonsingular coefficient matrices can be solved easily with the matrix inverse.  We will recycle <code>A</code> as a coefficient matrix, so be sure to execute the code above.</p>

<p>For square matrices, Sage has the methods <code>.is_singular()</code> and <code>.is_invertible()</code>.  By <acroref type="theorem" acro="NI" /> we know these two functions to be logical opposites.  One way to express this is that these two methods will always return different values.

<subsection acro="UM">
<title>Unitary Matrices</title>

<p>Recall that the adjoint of a matrix is $\adjoint{A}=\transpose{\left(\conjugate{A}\right)}$ (<acroref type="definition" acro="A" />).</p>

<definition acro="UM" index="matrix!unitary">
<title>Unitary Matrices</title>
<p>Suppose that $U$ is a square matrix of size $n$ such that $\adjoint{U}U=I_n$.  Then we say $U$ is <define>unitary</define>.</p>

</definition>

<p>This condition may seem rather far-fetched at first glance.  Would there be <em>any</em> matrix that behaved this way?  Well, yes, here is one.</p>

<example acro="UM3" index="unitary!size 3">
<title>Unitary matrix of size 3</title>

U=
\begin{bmatrix}

The computations get a bit tiresome, but if you work your way through the computation of $\adjoint{U}U$, you <em>will</em> arrive at the $3\times 3$ identity matrix $I_3$.</p>

<p>Unitary matrices do not have to look quite so gruesome.  Here is a larger one that is a bit more pleasing.</p>

is unitary as can be easily checked.  Notice that it is just a rearrangement of the columns of the $5\times 5$ identity matrix, $I_5$ (<acroref type="definition" acro="IM" />).</p>

<p>An interesting exercise is to build another $5\times 5$ unitary matrix, $R$, using a different rearrangement of the columns of $I_5$.  Then form the product $PR$.  This will be another unitary matrix (<acroref type="exercise" acro="MINM.T10" />).  If you were to build all $5!=5\times 4\times 3\times 2\times 1=120$ matrices of this type you would have a set that remains closed under matrix multiplication.  It is an example of another algebraic structure known as a <define>group</define> since together the set and the one operation (matrix multiplication here) is closed, associative, has an identity ($I_5$), and inverses (<acroref type="theorem" acro="UMI" />).  Notice though that the operation in this group is not commutative!</p>

</example>

<p>If a matrix $A$ has only real number entries (we say it is a <define>real matrix</define>) then the defining property of being unitary simplifies to $\transpose{A}A=I_n$.  In this case we, and everybody else, call the matrix <define>orthogonal</define>, so you may often encounter this term in your other reading when the complex numbers are not under consideration.</p>

<p>Unitary matrices have easily computed inverses.  They also have columns that form orthonormal sets.  Here are the theorems that show us that unitary matrices are not as strange as they might initially appear.</p>

<theorem acro="UMI" index="matrix!unitary is invertible">
<title>Unitary Matrices are Invertible</title>
<statement>
<p>Suppose that $U$ is a unitary matrix of size $n$.  Then $U$ is nonsingular, and $\inverse{U}=\adjoint{U}$.</p>

</statement>

<proof>
<p>By <acroref type="definition" acro="UM" />, we know that $\adjoint{U}U=I_n$.  The matrix $I_n$ is nonsingular (since it row-reduces easily to $I_n$, <acroref type="theorem" acro="NMRRI" />).  So by <acroref type="theorem" acro="NPNT" />, $U$ and $\adjoint{U}$ are both nonsingular matrices.</p>

<p>The equation $\adjoint{U}U=I_n$ gets us halfway to an inverse of $U$, and <acroref type="theorem" acro="OSIS" /> tells us that then $U\adjoint{U}=I_n$ also.  So $U$ and $\adjoint{U}$ are inverses of each other (<acroref type="definition" acro="MI" />).</p>

Or, because the inner product is anti-commutative (<acroref type="theorem" acro="IPAC" />) you only need check  three inner products (see <acroref type="exercise" acro="MINM.T12" />).</p>

</example>

<p>When using vectors and matrices that only have real number entries, orthogonal matrices are those matrices with inverses that equal their transpose.  Similarly, the inner product is the familiar dot product.  Keep this special case in mind as you read the next theorem.</p>

</proof>
</theorem>

<p>Aside from the inherent interest in this theorem, it makes a bigger statement about unitary matrices.  When we view vectors geometrically as directions or forces, then the norm equates to a notion of length.  If we transform a vector by multiplication with a unitary matrix, then the length (norm) of that vector stays the same.  If we consider column vectors with two or three slots containing only real numbers, then the inner product of two such vectors is just the dot product, and this quantity can be used to compute the angle between two vectors.  When two vectors are multiplied (transformed) by the same unitary matrix, their dot product is unchanged and their individual lengths are unchanged.  This results in the angle between the two vectors remaining unchanged.</p>

<p>A <q>unitary transformation</q> (matrix-vector products with unitary matrices) thus preserve geometrical relationships among vectors representing directions, forces, or other physical quantities.  In the case of a two-slot vector with real entries, this is simply a rotation.  These sorts of computations are exceedingly important in computer graphics such as games and real-time simulations, especially when increased realism is achieved by performing many such computations quickly.  We will see unitary matrices again in subsequent sections (especially <acroref type="theorem" acro="OD" />) and in each instance, consider the interpretation of the unitary matrix as a sort of geometry-preserving transformation.  Some authors use the term <define>isometry</define> to highlight this behavior.  We will speak loosely of a unitary matrix as being a sort of generalized rotation.</p>

<sageadvice acro="UM" index="unitary matrices">
<title>Unitary Matrices</title>

<p>No surprise about how we check if a matrix is unitary.  Here is <acroref type="example" acro="UM3" />,</p>

<input>A = matrix(QQbar, [
    [(1+I)/sqrt(5), (3+2*I)/sqrt(55), (2+2*I)/sqrt(22)],
    [(1-I)/sqrt(5), (2+2*I)/sqrt(55),  (-3+I)/sqrt(22)],
    [    I/sqrt(5), (3-5*I)/sqrt(55),    (-2)/sqrt(22)]

<p>We can verify <acroref type="theorem" acro="UMPIP" />, where the vectors <code>u</code> and <code>v</code> are created randomly.  Try evaluating this compute cell with your own choices.</p>

<sage>
<input>u = random_vector(QQ, 3) + QQbar(I)*random_vector(QQ, 3)

<p>If you want to experiment with permutation matrices, Sage has these too.  We can create a permutation matrix from a list that indicates for each column the row with a one in it.  Notice that the product here of two permutation matrices is again a permutation matrix.</p>

<p>A final reminder:  the terms <q>dot product,</q> <q>symmetric matrix</q> and <q>orthogonal matrix</q> used in reference to vectors or matrices with real number entries are special cases of the terms <q>inner product,</q> <q>Hermitian matrix</q> and <q>unitary matrix</q> that we use for vectors or matrices with complex number entries, so keep that in mind as you read elsewhere.</p>

<problem contributor="markhamrick">Matrix multiplication interacts nicely with many operations.  But not always with transforming a matrix to reduced row-echelon form.  Suppose that $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix and $B$ is an $n\times p$ matrix.  Let $P$ be a matrix that is row-equivalent to $A$ and in reduced row-echelon form, $Q$ be a matrix that is row-equivalent to $B$ and in reduced row-echelon form, and let $R$ be a matrix that is row-equivalent to $AB$ and in reduced row-echelon form.  Is $PQ=R$?  (In other words, with nonstandard notation, is $\text{rref}(A)\text{rref}(B)=\text{rref}(AB)$?)<br /><br />
