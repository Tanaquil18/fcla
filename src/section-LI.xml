<introduction>
<p><q>Linear independence</q> is one of the most fundamental conceptual ideas in linear algebra, along with the notion of a span.  So this section, and the subsequent <acroref type="section" acro="LDS" />, will explore this new idea.</p>

</introduction>

<subsection acro="LISV">
<title>Linearly Independent Sets of Vectors</title>

<p><acroref type="theorem" acro="SLSLC" /> tells us that a solution to a homogeneous system of equations is a linear combination of the columns of the coefficient matrix that equals the zero vector.  We used just this situation to our advantage (twice!) in <acroref type="example" acro="SCAD" /> where we reduced the set of vectors used in a span construction from four down to two, by declaring certain vectors as surplus.  The next two definitions will allow us to formalize this situation.</p>

<definition acro="RLDCV" index="relation  of linear dependence">
<title>Relation of Linear Dependence for Column Vectors</title>
<p>Given a set of vectors $S=\set{\vectorlist{u}{n}}$, a true statement of the form
<equation>
\lincombo{\alpha}{u}{n}=\zerovector
</equation>
is a <define>relation of linear dependence</define> on $S$.  If this statement is formed in a trivial fashion, <ie /> $\alpha_i=0$, $1\leq i\leq n$, then we say it is the <define>trivial relation of linear dependence</define> on $S$.</p>

</definition>

<!--   Any changes here should be carried forward to Definition LI. -->
<definition acro="LICV" index="linear independence">
<title>Linear Independence of Column Vectors</title>
<p>The set of vectors $S=\set{\vectorlist{u}{n}}$ is <define>linearly dependent</define> if there is a relation of linear dependence on $S$ that is not trivial.  In the case where the <em>only</em> relation of linear dependence on $S$ is the trivial one, then $S$ is a <define>linearly independent</define> set of vectors.</p>

</definition>

<p>Notice that a relation of linear dependence is an <em>equation</em>.  Though most of it is a linear combination, it is not a linear combination (that would be a vector).  Linear independence is a property of a <em>set</em> of vectors.  It is easy to take a set of vectors, and an equal number of scalars, <em>all zero</em>, and form a linear combination that equals the zero vector.  When the easy way is the <em>only</em> way, then we say the set is linearly independent.  Here are a couple of examples.</p>

<example acro="LDS" index="linearly dependent set">
<title>Linearly dependent set in $\complex{5}$</title>

<p>Consider the set of $n=4$ vectors from $\complex{5}$,
<equation>
S=\set{
\colvector{2\\-1\\3\\1\\2},\,
\colvector{1\\2\\-1\\5\\2},\,
\colvector{2\\1\\-3\\6\\1},\,
\colvector{-6\\7\\-1\\0\\1}
}
</equation>
</p>

<p>To determine linear independence we first form a relation of linear dependence,
<equation>
\alpha_1\colvector{2\\-1\\3\\1\\2}+
\alpha_2\colvector{1\\2\\-1\\5\\2}+
\alpha_3\colvector{2\\1\\-3\\6\\1}+
\alpha_4\colvector{-6\\7\\-1\\0\\1}
=\zerovector
</equation>
</p>

<p>We know that $\alpha_1=\alpha_2=\alpha_3=\alpha_4=0$ is a solution to this equation, but that is of no interest whatsoever.  That is <em>always</em> the case, no matter what four vectors we might have chosen.  We are curious to know if there are other, nontrivial, solutions.  <acroref type="theorem" acro="SLSLC" /> tells us that we can find such solutions as solutions to the homogeneous system $\homosystem{A}$ where the coefficient matrix has these four vectors as columns, which we then row-reduce
<equation>
A=
\begin{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[2&1&2&-6\\]]>
<![CDATA[-1&2&1&7\\]]>
<![CDATA[3&-1&-3&-1\\]]>
<![CDATA[1&5&6&0\\]]>
<![CDATA[2&2&1&1]]>
\end{bmatrix}
\rref
\begin{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[\leading{1}&0&0&-2\\]]>
<![CDATA[0&\leading{1}&0&4\\]]>
<![CDATA[0&0&\leading{1}&-3\\]]>
<![CDATA[0&0&0&0\\]]>
<![CDATA[0&0&0&0]]>
\end{bmatrix}
</equation>
</p>

<p>We could solve this homogeneous system completely, but for this example all we need is one nontrivial solution.  Setting the lone free variable to any nonzero value, such as $x_4=1$, yields the nontrivial solution
<equation>
\vect{x}=\colvector{2\\-4\\3\\1}
</equation>
completing our application of <acroref type="theorem" acro="SLSLC" />, we have
<equation>
2\colvector{2\\-1\\3\\1\\2}+
(-4)\colvector{1\\2\\-1\\5\\2}+
3\colvector{2\\1\\-3\\6\\1}+
1\colvector{-6\\7\\-1\\0\\1}
=\zerovector
</equation>
</p>

<p>This is a relation of linear dependence on $S$ that is not trivial, so we conclude that $S$ is linearly dependent.
</p>

</example>

<example acro="LIS" index="linearly independent set">
<title>Linearly independent set in $\complex{5}$</title>

<p>Consider the set of $n=4$ vectors from $\complex{5}$,
<equation>
T=\set{
\colvector{2\\-1\\3\\1\\2},\,
\colvector{1\\2\\-1\\5\\2},\,
\colvector{2\\1\\-3\\6\\1},\,
\colvector{-6\\7\\-1\\1\\1}
}
</equation>
</p>

<p>To determine linear independence we first form a relation of linear dependence,
<equation>
\alpha_1\colvector{2\\-1\\3\\1\\2}+
\alpha_2\colvector{1\\2\\-1\\5\\2}+
\alpha_3\colvector{2\\1\\-3\\6\\1}+
\alpha_4\colvector{-6\\7\\-1\\1\\1}
=\zerovector
</equation>
</p>

<p>We know that $\alpha_1=\alpha_2=\alpha_3=\alpha_4=0$ is a solution to this equation, but that is of no interest whatsoever.  That is <em>always</em> the case, no matter what four vectors we might have chosen.  We are curious to know if there are other, nontrivial, solutions.  <acroref type="theorem" acro="SLSLC" /> tells us that we can find such solutions as solution to the homogeneous system $\linearsystem{B}{\zerovector}$ where the coefficient matrix has these four vectors as columns.  Row-reducing this coefficient matrix yields,
<alignmath>
B=
\begin{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[2&1&2&-6\\]]>
<![CDATA[-1&2&1&7\\]]>
<![CDATA[3&-1&-3&-1\\]]>
<![CDATA[1&5&6&1\\]]>
<![CDATA[2&2&1&1]]>
\end{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[&\rref]]>
\begin{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[\leading{1}&0&0&0\\]]>
<![CDATA[0&\leading{1}&0&0\\]]>
<![CDATA[0&0&\leading{1}&0\\]]>
<![CDATA[0&0&0&\leading{1}\\]]>
<![CDATA[0&0&0&0]]>
\end{bmatrix}
</alignmath>
</p>

<p>From the form of this matrix, we see that there are no free variables, so the solution is unique, and because the system is homogeneous, this unique solution is the trivial solution.  So we now know that there is but one way to combine the four vectors of $T$ into a relation of linear dependence, and that one way is the easy and obvious way.  In this situation we say that the set, $T$, is linearly independent.
</p>

</example>

<p><acroref type="example" acro="LDS" /> and <acroref type="example" acro="LIS" /> relied on solving a homogeneous system of equations to determine linear independence.  We can codify this process in a time-saving theorem.
</p>

<theorem acro="LIVHS" index="linear independence!homogeneous systems">
<title>Linearly Independent Vectors and Homogeneous Systems</title>
<statement>
<indexlocation index="homogeneous systems!linear independence" />
<p>Suppose that $S=\set{\vectorlist{v}{n}}\subseteq\complex{m}$ is a set of vectors and $A$ is the $m\times n$ matrix whose columns are the vectors in $S$.  Then $S$ is a linearly independent set if and only if the homogeneous system $\homosystem{A}$ has a unique solution.</p>
</statement>

<proof>
<p><implyreverse />  Suppose that $\homosystem{A}$ has a unique solution.  Since it is a homogeneous system, this solution must be the trivial solution $\vect{x}=\zerovector$.  By <acroref type="theorem" acro="SLSLC" />, this means that the only relation of linear dependence on $S$ is the trivial one.  So $S$ is linearly independent.</p>

<p><implyforward />  We will prove the contrapositive.  Suppose that $\linearsystem{A}{\zerovector}$ does not have a unique solution.  Since it is a homogeneous system, it is consistent (<acroref type="theorem" acro="HSC" />), and so must have infinitely many solutions (<acroref type="theorem" acro="PSSLS" />).  One of these infinitely many solutions must be nontrivial (in fact, almost all of them are), so choose one.  By <acroref type="theorem" acro="SLSLC" /> this nontrivial solution will give a nontrivial relation of linear dependence on $S$, so we can conclude that $S$ is a linearly dependent set.</p>

</proof>
</theorem>

<p>Since <acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVHS" /> is an equivalence, we can use it to determine the linear independence or dependence of any set of column vectors, just by creating a matrix and analyzing the row-reduced form.  Let us illustrate this with two more examples.
</p>

<example acro="LIHS" index="linearly independent!via homogeneous system">
<title>Linearly independent, homogeneous system</title>

<p>Is the set of vectors
<equation>
S=\set{
\colvector{2\\-1\\3\\4\\2},\,
\colvector{6\\2\\-1\\3\\4},\,
\colvector{4\\3\\-4\\5\\1}
}
</equation>
linearly independent or linearly dependent?</p>

<p><acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVHS" /> suggests we study the matrix, $A$, whose columns are the vectors in $S$.  Specifically, we are interested in the size of the solution set for the homogeneous system $\homosystem{A}$, so we row-reduce $A$.
<equation>
A=
\begin{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[2 & 6 & 4\\]]>
<![CDATA[-1 & 2 & 3\\]]>
<![CDATA[3 & -1 & -4\\]]>
<![CDATA[4 & 3 & 5\\]]>
<![CDATA[2 & 4 & 1]]>
\end{bmatrix}
\rref
\begin{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[\leading{1} & 0 & 0\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & \leading{1} & 0\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & 0 & \leading{1}\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & 0 & 0\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & 0 & 0]]>
\end{bmatrix}
</equation>
</p>

<p>Now, $r=3$, so there are $n-r=3-3=0$ free variables and we see that $\homosystem{A}$ has a unique solution  (<acroref type="theorem" acro="HSC" />, <acroref type="theorem" acro="FVCS" />).  By <acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVHS" />, the set $S$ is linearly independent.
</p>

</example>

<example acro="LDHS" index="linearly dependent!via homogeneous system">
<title>Linearly dependent, homogeneous system</title>

<p>Is the set of vectors
<equation>
S=\set{
\colvector{2\\-1\\3\\4\\2},\,
\colvector{6\\2\\-1\\3\\4},\,
\colvector{4\\3\\-4\\-1\\2}
}
</equation>
linearly independent or linearly dependent?</p>

<p><acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVHS" /> suggests we study the matrix, $A$, whose columns are the vectors in $S$.  Specifically, we are interested in the size of the solution set for the homogeneous system $\homosystem{A}$, so we row-reduce $A$.

<equation>
A=
\begin{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[2 & 6 & 4\\]]>
<![CDATA[-1 & 2 & 3\\]]>
<![CDATA[3 & -1 & -4\\]]>
<![CDATA[4 & 3 & -1\\]]>
<![CDATA[2 & 4 & 2]]>
\end{bmatrix}
\rref
\begin{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[\leading{1} & 0 & -1\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & \leading{1} & 1\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & 0 & 0\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & 0 & 0\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & 0 & 0]]>
\end{bmatrix}
</equation>
</p>

<p>Now, $r=2$, so there are $n-r=3-2=1$ free variables and we see that $\homosystem{A}$ has infinitely many solutions (<acroref type="theorem" acro="HSC" />, <acroref type="theorem" acro="FVCS" />).  By <acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVHS" />, the set $S$ is linearly dependent.</p>

</example>

<p>As an equivalence, <acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVHS" /> gives us a straightforward way to determine if a set of vectors is linearly independent or dependent.</p>

<p>Review <acroref type="example" acro="LIHS" /> and <acroref type="example" acro="LDHS" />.  They are very similar, differing only in the last two slots of the third vector.  This resulted in slightly different matrices when row-reduced, and slightly different values of $r$, the number of nonzero rows.  Notice, too, that we are less interested in the actual solution set, and more interested in its form or size.  These observations allow us to make a slight improvement in <acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVHS" />.</p>

<theorem acro="LIVRN" index="linear independence!r and n">
<title>Linearly Independent Vectors, $r$ and $n$</title>
<statement>
<p>Suppose that $S=\set{\vectorlist{v}{n}}\subseteq\complex{m}$ is a set of vectors and $A$ is the $m\times n$ matrix whose columns are the vectors in $S$.   Let $B$ be a matrix in reduced row-echelon form that is row-equivalent to $A$ and let $r$ denote the number of pivot columns in $B$.  Then $S$ is linearly independent if and only if $n=r$.</p>

</statement>

<proof>
<p><acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVHS" /> says the linear independence of $S$ is equivalent to the homogeneous linear system $\homosystem{A}$ having a unique solution.  Since $\homosystem{A}$ is consistent (<acroref type="theorem" acro="HSC" />) we can apply <acroref type="theorem" acro="CSRN" /> to see that the solution is unique exactly when $n=r$.
</p>

</proof>
</theorem>

<p>So now here is an example of the most straightforward way to determine if a set of column vectors is linearly independent or linearly dependent.  While this method can be quick and easy, do not forget the logical progression from the definition of linear independence through homogeneous system of equations which makes it possible.</p>

<example acro="LDRN" index="linearly dependent!$r$ and $n$">
<title>Linearly dependent, $r$ and $n$</title>

<p>Is the set of vectors

\colvector{-3\\1\\4\\2\\1\\2},\,
\colvector{6\\-2\\1\\4\\3\\2}
}
</equation>
linearly independent or linearly dependent?</p>

<p><acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVRN" /> suggests we place these vectors into a matrix as columns and analyze the row-reduced version of the matrix,
<equation>
\begin{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[2 & 9 & 1 & -3 & 6\\]]>
<![CDATA[-1 & -6 & 1 & 1 & -2\\]]>
<![CDATA[3 & -2 & 1 & 4 & 1\\]]>
<![CDATA[1 & 3 & 0 & 2 & 4\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & 2 & 0 & 1 & 3\\]]>

\rref
\begin{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[\leading{1} & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1\\]]>

<![CDATA[0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0]]>
\end{bmatrix}
</equation>
</p>

<p>Now we need only compute that
<![CDATA[$r=4<5=n$]]>
to recognize, via <acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVRN" /> that $S$ is a linearly dependent set.  Boom!</p>

</example>

<example acro="LLDS" index="linearly independent set">
<title>Large linearly dependent set in $\complex{4}$</title>

<p>Consider the set of $n=9$ vectors from $\complex{4}$,
<equation>
R=\set{
\colvector{-1\\3\\1\\2},\,
\colvector{7\\1\\-3\\6},\,
\colvector{1\\2\\-1\\-2},\,
\colvector{0\\4\\2\\9},\,
\colvector{5\\-2\\4\\3},\,
\colvector{2\\1\\-6\\4},\,
\colvector{3\\0\\-3\\1},\,
\colvector{1\\1\\5\\3},\,
\colvector{-6\\-1\\1\\1}
}.
</equation>
</p>

<p>To employ <acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVHS" />, we form a $4\times 9$ matrix, $C$, whose columns are the vectors in $R$
<equation>
C=
\begin{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[-1&7&1&0&5&2&3&1&-6\\]]>
<![CDATA[3&1&2&4&-2&1&0&1&-1\\]]>
<![CDATA[1&-3&-1&2&4&-6&-3&5&1\\]]>
<![CDATA[2&6&-2&9&3&4&1&3&1]]>
\end{bmatrix}.
</equation>
</p>

<!-- Can do quicker with LIVRN and counting, but want to use HMVEI -->
<p>To determine if the homogeneous system $\homosystem{C}$ has a unique solution or not, we would normally row-reduce this matrix.  But in this particular example, we can do better.  <acroref type="theorem" acro="HMVEI" /> tells us that since the system is homogeneous with $n=9$ variables in $m=4$ equations, and $n>m$, there must be infinitely many solutions.  Since there is not a unique solution, <acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVHS" /> says the set is linearly dependent.
</p>

</example>

<p>The situation in <acroref type="example" acro="LLDS" /> is slick enough to warrant formulating as a theorem.
</p>

<!-- See note on Example above -->
<theorem acro="MVSLD" index="linear dependence!more vectors than size">
<title>More Vectors than Size implies Linear Dependence</title>
<statement>
<p>Suppose that $S=\set{\vectorlist{u}{n}}\subseteq\complex{m}$ and $n>m$. Then $S$ is a linearly dependent set.</p>
</statement>

<proof>
<p>Form the $m\times n$ matrix $A$ whose columns are $\vect{u}_i$, $1\leq i\leq n$.  Consider the homogeneous system $\homosystem{A}$.  By <acroref type="theorem" acro="HMVEI" /> this system has infinitely many solutions.  Since the system does not have a unique solution, <acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVHS" /> says the columns of $A$ form a linearly dependent set, as desired.
</p>

</theorem>

<sageadvice acro="LI" index="linear independence">
<title>Linear Independence</title>

<p>We can use the Sage tools we already have, along with <acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVRN" />, to determine if sets are linearly independent.  There is just one hitch <mdash /> Sage has a preference for placing vectors into matrices as <em>rows</em>, rather than as columns.  When printing vectors on the screen, writing them <em>across</em> the screen makes good sense, and there are more mathematical reasons for this choice.  But we have chosen to present introductory linear algebra with an emphasis on the <em>columns</em> of matrices <mdash /> again, for good mathematical reasons.  Fortunately, Sage allows us to build matrices from columns as well as rows.</p>

<p>Let us redo <acroref type="example" acro="LDHS" />, the determination that a set of three vectors is linearly dependent.  We will enter the vectors, construct a matrix with the vectors as <em>columns</em> via the <code>column_matrix()</code> constructor, and analyze.  Here we go.</p>

<sage>
<input>v1 = vector(QQ, [2, -1,  3,  4, 2])
v2 = vector(QQ, [6,  2, -1,  3, 4])
v3 = vector(QQ, [4,  3, -4, -1, 2])
A = column_matrix([v1, v2, v3])
A
</input>
<output>[ 2  6  4]
[-1  2  3]
[ 3 -1 -4]
[ 4  3 -1]
[ 2  4  2]
</output>
</sage>

<sage>
<input>A.ncols() == len(A.pivots())
</input>
<output>False
</output>
</sage>

<p>Notice that we never explicitly row-reduce <code>A</code>, though this computation must happen behind the scenes when we compute the list of pivot columns.  We do not really care <em>where</em> the pivots are (the actual list), but rather we want to know <em>how many</em> there are, thus we ask about the <em>length</em> of the list with the function <code>len()</code>.  Once we construct the matrix, the analysis is quick.  With $n\neq r$, <acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVRN" /> tells us the set is linearly dependent.</p>

<p>Reprising <acroref type="example" acro="LIS" /> with Sage would be good practice at this point.  Here is an empty compute cell to use.</p>

<p>While it is extremely important to understand the approach outlined above, Sage has a convenient tool for working with linear independence. <code>.linear_dependence()</code>  is a method for vector spaces, which we feed in a list of vectors.  The output is again a list of vectors, each one containing the scalars that yield a nontrivial relation of linear dependence on the input vectors.  We will give this method a workout in the next section, but for now we are interested in the case of a linearly independent set.  In this instance, the method will return nothing (an empty list, really).  Not even the all-zero vector is produced, since it is not interesting and definitely is not surprising.</p>

<p>Again, we will not say anymore about the output of this method until the next section, and do not let its use replace a good conceptual understanding of this section.  We will redo <acroref type="example" acro="LDHS" /> again, you try <acroref type="example" acro="LIS" /> again.  If you are playing along, be sure <code>v1, v2, v3</code> are defined from the code above.</p>

<sage>
<input>L = [v1, v2, v3]
V = QQ^5
V.linear_dependence(L) == []
</input>
<output>False
</output>
</sage>

<p>The only comment to make here is that we need to create the vector space <code>QQ^5</code> since <code>.linear_dependence()</code> is a method of vector spaces.  <acroref type="example" acro="LIS" /> should proceed similarly, though being a linearly independent set, the comparison with the empty list should yield <code>True</code>.</p>

<subsection acro="LINM">
<title>Linear Independence and Nonsingular Matrices</title>

<p>We will now specialize to sets of $n$ vectors from $\complex{n}$.  This will put <acroref type="theorem" acro="MVSLD" /> off-limits, while <acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVHS" /> will involve square matrices.  Let us begin by contrasting <acroref type="archetype" acro="A" /> and <acroref type="archetype" acro="B" />.

<subsection acro="NSSLI">
<title>Null Spaces, Spans, Linear Independence</title>

<p>In <acroref type="subsection" acro="SS.SSNS" /> we proved <acroref type="theorem" acro="SSNS" /> which provided $n-r$ vectors that could be used with the span construction to build the entire null space of a matrix.  As we have hinted in <acroref type="example" acro="SCAD" />, and as we will see again going forward, linearly dependent sets carry redundant vectors with them when used in building a set as a span.  Our aim now is to show that the vectors provided by <acroref type="theorem" acro="SSNS" /> form a linearly independent set, so in one sense they are as efficient as possible a way to describe the null space.  Notice that the vectors $\vect{z}_j$, $1\leq j\leq n-r$ first appear in the vector form of solutions to arbitrary linear systems (<acroref type="theorem" acro="VFSLS" />).  The exact same vectors appear again in the span construction in the conclusion of <acroref type="theorem" acro="SSNS" />.  Since this second theorem specializes to homogeneous systems the only real difference is that the vector $\vect{c}$ in <acroref type="theorem" acro="VFSLS" /> is the zero vector for a homogeneous system.  Finally, <acroref type="theorem" acro="BNS" /> will now show that these same vectors are a linearly independent set.  We will set the stage for the proof of this theorem with a moderately large example.  Study the example carefully, as it will make it easier to understand the proof.</p>

<example acro="LINSB" index="null space!linearly independent basis">
<title>Linear independence of null space basis</title>

<p>Suppose that we are interested in the null space of a $3\times 7$ matrix, $A$, which row-reduces to
<equation>
B=
\begin{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[\leading{1} & 0 & -2 & 4 & 0 & 3 & 9\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & \leading{1} & 5 & 6 & 0 & 7 & 1\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \leading{1} & 8 & -5]]>
\end{bmatrix}
</equation></p>

<p>The set $F=\set{3,\,4,\,6,\,7}$ is the set of indices for our four free variables that would be used in a description of the solution set for the homogeneous system $\homosystem{A}$.  Applying <acroref type="theorem" acro="SSNS" /> we can begin to construct a set of four vectors whose span is the null space of $A$, a set of vectors we will reference as $T$.
<equation>
\nsp{A}=\spn{T}=\spn{\set{\vect{z}_1,\,\vect{z}_2,\,\vect{z}_3,\,\vect{z}_4}}=\spn{\set{
\colvector{ \\ \\1\\0\\ \\0\\0},\,
\colvector{ \\ \\0\\1\\ \\0\\0},\,
\colvector{ \\ \\0\\0\\ \\1\\0},\,
\colvector{ \\ \\0\\0\\ \\0\\1}
}}
</equation>
</p>

<p>So far, we have constructed as much of these individual vectors as we can, based just on the knowledge of the contents of the set $F$.  This has allowed us to determine the entries in slots 3, 4, 6 and 7, while we have left slots 1, 2 and 5 blank.  Without doing any more, let us ask if $T$  is linearly independent?  Begin with a relation of linear dependence on $T$, and see what we can learn about the scalars,
<alignmath>
<![CDATA[\zerovector&=\alpha_1\vect{z}_1+\alpha_2\vect{z}_2+\alpha_3\vect{z}_3+\alpha_4\vect{z}_4\\]]>
\colvector{0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0\\0}
<![CDATA[&=]]>
\alpha_1\colvector{ \\ \\1\\0\\ \\0\\0}+
\alpha_2\colvector{ \\ \\0\\1\\ \\0\\0}+
\alpha_3\colvector{ \\ \\0\\0\\ \\1\\0}+
\alpha_4\colvector{ \\ \\0\\0\\ \\0\\1}\\
<![CDATA[&=]]>
\colvector{ \\ \\\alpha_1\\0\\ \\0\\0}+
\colvector{ \\ \\0\\\alpha_2\\ \\0\\0}+
\colvector{ \\ \\0\\0\\ \\\alpha_3\\0}+
\colvector{ \\ \\0\\0\\ \\0\\\alpha_4}
=
\colvector{ \\ \\\alpha_1\\\alpha_2\\ \\\alpha_3\\\alpha_4}
</alignmath>
</p>

<p>Applying <acroref type="definition" acro="CVE" /> to the two ends of this chain of equalities, we see that $\alpha_1=\alpha_2=\alpha_3=\alpha_4=0$.  So the only relation of linear dependence on the set $T$ is a trivial one.  By <acroref type="definition" acro="LICV" /> the set $T$ is linearly independent.  The important feature of this example is how the <q>pattern of zeros and ones</q> in the four vectors led to the conclusion of linear independence.</p>

</example>

<p>The proof of <acroref type="theorem" acro="BNS" /> is really quite straightforward, and relies on the <q>pattern of zeros and ones</q> that arise in the vectors $\vect{z}_i$, $1\leq i\leq n-r$ in the entries that arise with the locations of the non-pivot columns.  Play along with <acroref type="example" acro="LINSB" /> as you study the proof.   Also, take a look at <acroref type="example" acro="VFSAD" />, <acroref type="example" acro="VFSAI" /> and <acroref type="example" acro="VFSAL" />, especially at the conclusion of Step 2 (temporarily ignore the construction of the constant vector, $\vect{c}$).  This proof is also a good first example of how to prove a conclusion that states a set is linearly independent.
</p>

<theorem acro="BNS" index="null space!basis">
<title>Basis for Null Spaces</title>
<statement>
<p>Suppose that $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix, and $B$ is a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form with $r$ pivot columns.  Let $D=\{d_1,\,d_2,\,d_3,\,\ldots,\,d_r\}$ and $F=\{f_1,\,f_2,\,f_3,\,\ldots,\,f_{n-r}\}$ be the sets of column indices where $B$ does and does not (respectively) have pivot columns.  Construct the $n-r$ vectors $\vect{z}_j$, $1\leq j\leq n-r$ of size $n$ as
<equation>
\vectorentry{\vect{z}_j}{i}=
\begin{cases}
<![CDATA[1&\text{if $i\in F$, $i=f_j$}\\]]>
<![CDATA[0&\text{if $i\in F$, $i\neq f_j$}\\]]>
<![CDATA[-\matrixentry{B}{k,f_j}&\text{if $i\in D$, $i=d_k$}]]>
\end{cases}
</equation></p>

<p>
Define the set $S=\set{\vectorlist{z}{n-r}}$.Then
<ol><li> $\nsp{A}=\spn{S}$.
</li><li> $S$ is a linearly independent set.
</li></ol></p>

</statement>

<proof>
<p>Notice first that the vectors $\vect{z}_j$, $1\leq j\leq n-r$ are exactly the same as the $n-r$ vectors defined in <acroref type="theorem" acro="SSNS" />.  Also, the hypotheses of <acroref type="theorem" acro="SSNS" /> are the same as the hypotheses of the theorem we are currently proving.  So it is then simply the conclusion of <acroref type="theorem" acro="SSNS" /> that tells us that $\nsp{A}=\spn{S}$.  That was the easy half, but the second part is not much harder.  What is new here is the claim that $S$ is a linearly independent set.</p>

<p>To prove the linear independence of a set, we need to start with a relation of linear dependence and somehow conclude that the scalars involved <em>must all be zero</em>, <ie /> that the relation of linear dependence only happens in the trivial fashion.  So to establish the linear independence of $S$, we start with
<equation>
\lincombo{\alpha}{z}{n-r}=\zerovector.
</equation>
</p>

<p>For each $j$, $1\leq j\leq n-r$, consider the equality of the individual entries of the vectors on both sides of this equality in position $f_j$,

<![CDATA[&=\alpha_{j}]]>
</alignmath>
</p>

<p>So for all $j$, $1\leq j\leq n-r$, we have $\alpha_j=0$, which is the conclusion that tells us that the <em>only</em> relation of linear dependence on $S=\set{\vectorlist{z}{n-r}}$ is the trivial one.  Hence, by <acroref type="definition" acro="LICV" /> the set is linearly independent, as desired.</p>

<example acro="NSLIL" index="null space span, linearly independent!Archetype L">
<title>Null space spanned by linearly independent set,  Archetype L</title>

<indexlocation index="Archetype L!null space span, linearly independent" />
<p>In <acroref type="example" acro="VFSAL" /> we previewed <acroref type="theorem" acro="SSNS" /> by finding a set of two vectors such that their span was the null space for the matrix in <acroref type="archetype" acro="L" />.  Writing the matrix as $L$, we have
<equation>
\nsp{L}=
\spn{<archetypepart acro="L" part="nullspacebasis" />}</equation>
Solving the homogeneous system $\homosystem{L}$ resulted in recognizing $x_4$ and $x_5$ as the free variables.  So look in entries 4 and 5 of the two vectors above and notice the pattern of zeros and ones that provides the linear independence of the set.</p>

</example>

<sageadvice acro="LISS" index="linearly independent spanning sets">
<title>Linearly Independent Spanning Sets</title>

<p>No new commands here, but instead we can now reveal and explore one of our Sage mysteries.  When we create a null space with <code>.right_kernel(basis='pivot')</code>, or a span with <code>.span()</code>, Sage internally creates a new spanning set for the null space or span.  We see the vectors of these spanning sets as the rows of the <code>Basis matrix</code> or <code>User basis matrix</code> when we print one of these sets.</p>

<p>But more than a spanning set, these vectors are always a linearly independent set.  The advantages of this will have to wait for more theory, but for now, this may explain why the spanning set changes (and sometimes shrinks).  We can also demonstrate this behavior, by creating the span of a large set of (linearly dependent) vectors.</p>

<input>V = QQ^5
v1 = vector(QQ, [ 5,   2, -11, -24, -17])

v3 = vector(QQ, [ 8,  29,  -9,  -4,  33])
v4 = vector(QQ, [ 1,   1,  -2,  -4,  -2])
v5 = vector(QQ, [-7, -25,   8,   4, -28])
v6 = vector(QQ, [ 0,  -3,  -1,  -4,  -7])
v7 = vector(QQ, [-1,   2,   3,   8,   9])

<p>So the above examines properties of the two vectors, <code>S</code>, that Sage computes for the span <code>W</code> built from the seven vectors in the set <code>L</code>.  We see that the span of <code>S</code> is equal to the span of <code>L</code> via the comparison <code>X == W</code>.  And the smaller set, <code>S</code>, is linearly independent, as promised.  Notice that we do not need to use Sage to know that <code>L</code> is linearly dependent, this is guaranteed by <acroref type="theorem" acro="MVSLD" />.</p>

To apply <acroref type="theorem" acro="BNS" /> or <acroref type="theorem" acro="VFSLS" /> we first row-reduce the matrix, resulting in
<equation>
B=

<![CDATA[ 0 & 0 & 0 & \leading{1} & -4 \\]]>
<![CDATA[ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0]]>

So we see that $n-r=5-3=2$ and $F=\set{2,5}$, so the vector form of a generic solution vector is

To find relations of linear dependence, we formulate a matrix $A$ whose columns are $\vect{v}_1,\,\vect{v}_2,\,\vect{v}_3,\,\vect{v}_4,\,\vect{v}_5$.  Then we consider the homogeneous system of equations $\homosystem{A}$ by row-reducing its coefficient matrix (remember that if we formulated the augmented matrix we would just add a column of zeros).  After row-reducing, we obtain
<equation>
\begin{bmatrix}
<![CDATA[\leading{1} & 0 & 0 & 2 & -1\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & \leading{1} & 0 & 1 & -2\\]]>
<![CDATA[0 & 0 & \leading{1} & 0 & 0]]>
\end{bmatrix}
</equation>
From this we find that solutions can be obtained employing the free variables $x_4$ and $x_5$.  With appropriate choices we will be able to conclude that vectors $\vect{v}_4$ and $\vect{v}_5$ are unnecessary for creating
$W$ via a span.  By <acroref type="theorem" acro="SLSLC" /> the choice of free variables below lead to solutions and linear combinations, which are then rearranged.
<alignmath>
<![CDATA[x_4=1, x_5=0&&\Rightarrow&&(-2)\vect{v}_1+(-1)\vect{v}_2+(0)\vect{v}_3+(1)\vect{v}_4+(0)\vect{v}_5=\zerovector&&\Rightarrow&&\vect{v}_4=2\vect{v}_1+\vect{v}_2\\]]>

</alignmath>
Since $\vect{v}_4$ and $\vect{v}_5$ can be expressed as linear combinations of $\vect{v}_1$ and $\vect{v}_2$  we can say that $\vect{v}_4$ and $\vect{v}_5$ are not needed for the linear combinations used to build $W$ (a claim that we could establish carefully with a pair of set equality arguments).  Thus
<equation>
W=\spn{\set{\vect{v}_1,\,\vect{v}_2,\,\vect{v}_3}}=\spn{\set{\colvector{2\\1\\1},\,\colvector{-1\\-1\\1},\,\colvector{1\\2\\3}}}
</equation>
That the $\set{\vect{v}_1,\,\vect{v}_2,\,\vect{v}_3}$ is linearly independent set can be established quickly with <acroref type="theorem" acro="LIVRN" />.<br /><br />
There are other answers to this question, but notice that any nontrivial linear combination of $\vect{v}_1,\,\vect{v}_2,\,\vect{v}_3,\,\vect{v}_4,\,\vect{v}_5$ will have a zero coefficient on $\vect{v}_3$, so this vector can never be eliminated from the set used to build the span.<br /><br />

$\vect{v}_1$ is a nonzero vector, so in a set all by itself we have a linearly independent set.  As $\vect{v}_2$ is a scalar multiple of $\vect{v}_1$, the equation $-4\vect{v}_1+\vect{v}_2=\zerovector$ is a relation of linear dependence on $\set{\vect{v}_1,\,\vect{v}_2}$, so we will pass on $\vect{v}_2$.  No such relation of linear dependence exists on $\set{\vect{v}_1,\,\vect{v}_3}$, though on $\set{\vect{v}_1,\,\vect{v}_3,\,\vect{v}_4}$ we have the relation of linear dependence
$7\vect{v}_1+3\vect{v}_3+\vect{v}_4=\zerovector$.

<![CDATA[\alpha_1=0&&\alpha_2=0&&\alpha_3=0&&\alpha_4=0]]>
</alignmath>
This means, by <acroref type="definition" acro="LICV" />, that the original set
<equation>
\set{
\vect{v}_1,\,
\vect{v}_1+\vect{v}_2,\,
\vect{v}_1+\vect{v}_2+\vect{v}_3,\,
\vect{v}_1+\vect{v}_2+\vect{v}_3+\vect{v}_4
}
</equation>
is linearly independent.

<exercise type="T" number="50" rough=" l.i. columns, consistent system, implies uniq soln">
<problem contributor="robertbeezer">Suppose that $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix with linearly independent columns and the linear system $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ is consistent.  Show that this system has a unique solution.  (Notice that we are not requiring $A$ to be square.)
</problem>
<solution contributor="robertbeezer">Let $A=\matrixcolumns{A}{n}$.  $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$ is consistent, so we know the system has at least one solution (<acroref type="definition" acro="CS" />).  We would like to show that there are no more than one solution to the system.  Employing <acroref type="technique" acro="U" />, suppose that $\vect{x}$ and $\vect{y}$ are two solution vectors for $\linearsystem{A}{\vect{b}}$.  By <acroref type="theorem" acro="SLSLC" /> we know we can write,
<alignmath>
<![CDATA[\vect{b}&=]]>
\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{1}A_1+
\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{2}A_2+
\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{3}A_3+
\cdots+
\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{n}A_n\\
<![CDATA[\vect{b}&=]]>
\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{1}A_1+
\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{2}A_2+
\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{3}A_3+
\cdots+
\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{n}A_n
</alignmath>
Then
<alignmath>
\zerovector
<![CDATA[&=\vect{b}-\vect{b}\\]]>
<![CDATA[&=]]>
\left(
\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{1}A_1+
\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{2}A_2+
\cdots+
\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{n}A_n
\right)
-
\left(
\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{1}A_1+
\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{2}A_2+
\cdots+
\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{n}A_n
\right)\\
<![CDATA[&=]]>
\left(\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{1}-\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{1}\right)A_1+
\left(\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{2}-\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{2}\right)A_2+
\cdots+
\left(\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{n}-\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{n}\right)A_n
</alignmath>
This is a relation of linear dependence (<acroref type="definition" acro="RLDCV" />) on a linearly independent set (the columns of $A$).  So the scalars <em>must</em> all be zero,
<alignmath>
<![CDATA[\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{1}-\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{1}&=0]]>
<![CDATA[&]]>
<![CDATA[\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{2}-\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{2}&=0]]>
<![CDATA[&]]>
<![CDATA[\dots&]]>
<![CDATA[&]]>
<![CDATA[\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{n}-\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{n}&=0]]>
</alignmath>
Rearranging these equations yields the statement that $\vectorentry{\vect{x}}{i}=\vectorentry{\vect{y}}{i}$, for $1\leq i\leq n$.  However, this is exactly how we define vector equality (<acroref type="definition" acro="CVE" />), so $\vect{x}=\vect{y}$ and the system has only one solution.
